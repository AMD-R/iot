# iot
IOT module for AMD-R

# Configuration
The http client for the iot system requires a YAML configuration file to work.
The configuration can be set by creaing a `cfg/server.yml` file or generated by the AMD-R`welcome` package
An example `server.yml` file is shown below:

``` yaml
host: 'http://localhost'
port: 5000
# A file name set by private_key and public_key must exist in the same directory containing it's respective key
private_key: 'private.pem'
public_key: 'public.pem'
# A password for the private key is not needed, leave it empty if there is none
password: 'password'
```
